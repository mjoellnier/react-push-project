# React Push Project

This is my test project to get my hands dirty with push notfications to a ReactJS PWA. As this is my _get to know project_ I highly appreciate every pull request or any other feedback that arrives to me. We can get in touch via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coding_max) - feel free to contact me there!

# Client project

The client project contains a installable ReactJS PWA that triggers a automatic push notification on visit (as soon as you approved you want the messages).

## Client Screenshots
